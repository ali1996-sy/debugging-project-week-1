This project should be completed in groups. Generate a new repo for your team using debugging-project-week-1 and have at it.

Some things to think about when writing your development strategy:

Is one challenge one step? ie.
Convert to F: HTML, CSS, JS
Reverse a String: HTML, CSS, JS
...
Or are there longer phases to development (milestones)?
Finish the entire UI
Pass all the tests: convert to c, convert to f, ...
Write all the handlers: convert to c, convert to f, ...
How much work should go on each issue?
How do you want to divide the work?
Does one person write the entire UI?
Does each person write the UI for their challenge?
Does one person pass all the tests, and another writes the handlers?
